After recalling the basic definitions on (systems of) multivariate polynomials, we present the main construction methods of multivariate public key cryptosystems. We discuss the mathematical problems underlying the security of multivariate cryptography and give an overview of the main attacks against these schemes. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of multivariate schemes compared to other (post-quantum) cryptosystems.",
