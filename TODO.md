# Todo list

- Alter Sage code
  - Make sure it handles different integer sizes according to C code.
  - Cleanup 
- Cleanup C code
  - [ ] mq_config.h
- Finish solver code (in C)
  - [ ] output_potentials and solve
- Optimize C-code
  - [ ] Multicore
    - Strategies:
      - Worker threads and master thread
      - Fix variables and run multiple systems
      - Thread for subprocedures like FES
  - [ ] Smaller algorithmic changes
  - [ ] Smaller C-stuff (unrolling, register vars, etc.)
- Get some pages written
  - [ ] Come on...
  - [ ] Make a README for this repo
- Compare speedups
  - [ ] Sage to C
  - [ ] C optimizations
